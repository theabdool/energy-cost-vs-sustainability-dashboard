Project Title
Optimizing Energy Use: Cost vs. Sustainability Dashboard
## Description
This Power BI dashboard project analyzes the balance between energy cost and sustainability. It compares renewable vs. non-renewable energy consumption, seasonal trends, and YoY changes across major cities, offering data-driven insights into cost-efficiency and environmental impact.
## Problem Statement
Energy providers and sustainability officers face a critical trade-off between:
 -Using clean renewable energy, which reduces emissions but increases costs.
 -Using cheap non-renewable energy, which is cost-effective but environmentally harmful.
This dashboard quantifies both aspects—cost and sustainability—so decision-makers can plan more responsibly.
## Tools Used
 - Power BI – Data visualization, YoY analysis, DAX measures, seasonality analysis
 - Card, Bar, Line, and Candlesticks Charts** – for breakdowns across time and location
 - Conditional formatting & tooltips – to highlight trends and compare city performance
## Process Summary
**Data Preparation:**
 - Imported monthly and seasonal energy usage across 3 cities
 - Calculated renewable share, emission factors, and cost per kWh
**Dashboard Development:**
- Built key metrics cards (Total kWh, cost, emissions, share %)
- Visualized YoY change for cities using error bars and growth indicators
- Trend lines for monthly consumption
- Seasonal consumption breakdown
## Key Insights
- Total energy use = 56.87M kWh, with 58.06% from renewable sources
- Summer leads in renewable energy usage (10.5M kWh), followed by Autumn and Winter
- Energy cost per kWh = $0.17, with renewables costing 38.4% more than non-renewables
- Atlanta and Chicago saw YoY drops in renewable energy, while New York grew by +17.6%
- April is the lowest renewable month, while August peaks at 4.8M kWh
- Emissions remain significant (389.82 kg CO2/kWh), with optimization needed

## Recommendations
- Rebalance cost vs sustainability by combining cheaper non-renewables during low-yield months (e.g., April)
- Capitalize on summer energy generation through storage or redistribution
- Encourage cities like Atlanta/Chicago to adopt strategies similar to New York’s +17.6% growth
- Monitor seasonal patterns to plan demand and supply cycles more efficiently
- Reassess energy procurement policies to lower average cost per kWh without compromising sustainability goals
  Challenges & Fixes
Visual overload from multiple metrics → Broke visuals into clean, readable sections

YoY comparisons needed context → Added % change indicators with arrows

Mixed units (kWh, cost, emissions) → Standardized all units and added hover tooltips
